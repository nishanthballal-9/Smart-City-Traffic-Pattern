# Smart-City-Traffic-Pattern

To help develop a robust traffic system for a smart city plan by predicting the traffic patterns at the four junctions of a city (available data). The model takes into account the traffic pattern on holidays and compares it with usual day traffic. The model applies random forest algorithm to predict the number of vehicles in each junction for the next 4 months.
